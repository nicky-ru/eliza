### üìù **Instructions for the Agent**

Based on the state information, metrics, and project data provided above, perform the analysis requested by the user.

While focusing on the user's specific request, you may optionally include the following types of analysis if relevant:

1. **Top Projects by Market Cap**:
   - Identify the projects with the highest market capitalization and list them in descending order.

2. **Token Price Insights**:
   - Compare the token prices of different projects and highlight any significant differences.

3. **Network Status Overview**:
   - Group the projects based on their network status (e.g., Mainnet, Testnet).

4. **Layer 1 Distribution**:
   - Analyze how many projects are deployed on each Layer 1 blockchain.

5. **Categories Breakdown**:
   - List the different categories each project belongs to and summarize the focus areas.

6. **Key Insights**:
   - Provide high-level observations based on the data, such as trends, notable outliers, or potential opportunities.

---

### üéØ **Agent‚Äôs Objective**

Prioritize delivering the analysis requested by the user. Include additional insights or analysis types from the list above **only if they support or enhance the user‚Äôs request**.
